# E.14-and-EE.09-exams
You can find completed practical exams by me. I've done them due to need of practise for passing this exam officially later. Basically, i had to use mySQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP languages. Also, i needed to design a graphic in few tests. 
I upload neccesary original files for each task and make a copy or create neccesary files. You can use mine as example of completing whole exam. To know what is needed to do, use pdf file. It's in Polish though.
